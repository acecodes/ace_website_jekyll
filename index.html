    <h3 class="content"><b>A business without data is a business without a future.</b></h3>
    <hr />
    <p class="subp">Using your "gut" doesn't work in this era of dog-eat-dog business. You need to know how to navigate the data landscape of your industry and, most importantly, find actionable insights within it.</p>
    <p>It's easy to fall into thinking "hey, my business is doing fine - I don't need to use any fancy data tools." But, like most easy things in life, this way of thinking is flat out wrong. No matter what industry you're in, and no matter how big or small you are now, using data in your business decisions is a must. Without it, you have no way to know if the money you're putting into the growth of your business is having the desired effect.</p>
    <p>The world is filled with random noise and, even worse, service providers who rely on sleight of hand to keep their customers. How do you really know that the advertising campaign you just bought with your hard-earned dollars is actually driving new customers? Without a proper data collection and analytics process, you're just taking stabs in the dark.</p>

    <h3 class="content"><b>A slow website lowers sales.</b></h3>
    <hr />
    <p class="subp">We're living in the middle of an era in which customers are not willing to wait to get what they want. As a result, you aren't just competing with other businesses in the same industry - you're also competing with the short attention spans of consumers.</p>
    <p>Don't believe me? Take it from Ilya Grigorik, who works on Google's performance team and wrote the seminal book on website performance:</p>
    <div class="well">
        <p><em>We are not accustomed to measuring our everyday encounters in milliseconds, but studies have shown that most of us will reliably report perceptible "lag" once a delay of over 100–200 milliseconds is introduced into the system. Once the 300 millisecond delay threshold is exceeded, the interaction is often reported as "sluggish," and at the 1,000 milliseconds (1 second) barrier, many users have already performed a mental context switch while waiting for the response—anything from a daydream to thinking about the next urgent task. (<a href="http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000545/ch01.html#PROPAGATION_LATENCY">Source</a>)</em></p>
    </div>
    <p>Think about that for a moment: web users are so used to instant results that a delay of a <em>single second</em> causes them to think about something else! This means that if a competitor has a website that loads faster than yours, you will lose customers to them. Doing business on the internet is tough - don't make it harder on yourself by letting a slow web presence drive customers away.</p>

        <h3>Conversion rate optimization</h3>
        <p>Conversion rate optimization (or CRO for short) is the process of getting more revenue out of the people who are already visiting your site. This is a service generally needed by people who have built a growing web-based business who aren't sure how to get the most bang for their marketing buck. It involves regularly tweaking your client-facing marketing and using data to evaluate how effective those tweaks are.</p>

    <div class="well services-list">
        <h3>Website performance evaluation</h3>

This service is ideally suited to businesses that are in highly competitive markets with younger (18-35) customers. </p>
