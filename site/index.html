        <h1 id="intro">Let's solve problems together.</h1>
        <p>The best technologies make your life easier. Instead of having to perform repetitive, dangerous or time-consuming tasks, you should be able to simply tell a machine "make it so" and then <strong>spend your precious time on the things you truly care about</strong>.</p>
        <p>My name is <strong>Ace Eddleman</strong>. I'm a <a href="//github.com/acecodes">software engineer</a>, <a href="//www.52aces.com">author</a> and learning consultant. My goal is to help you solve your most time-consuming problems with technology and efficient training.</p>
        <h2 id="list-header">How I Can Help You</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Software Engineering - </strong> The most straightforward way to solve problems is by writing software that can do it for you. What this will mean for you specifically depends on your needs. Do you have to process large amounts of data every day? Are the actions you perform on a regular basis predictable in any way? Is there some task you have to regularly perform that sucks up a ton of your time? Software is generally a good fit for problems like these.</p>
                <p>My specialties are RESTful APIs and single-page applications (SPAs). The technologies I use most often are Python (usually Django or Flask) and JavaScript (primarily Angular and Node), although I have worked with a large number of languages and frameworks.</p>
                <p>Quite a few people have asked me about learning how to program, and after writing far too many long emails about the subject, I put the gist of my thoughts into a <a href="//52aces.com/blog/learning-how-to-program/">single blog post</a>. If you're considering contacting me to ask about becoming a programmer, please read this post before sending me a message.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Data Analysis - </strong> You can no longer afford to operate solely on "gut instincts." The environment facing every employee and entrepreneur is extremely competitive. The only way to see through all the noise and give yourself a leg up is by drawing conclusions from cold, hard data. Individuals can use the story data tells to track their progress towards goals, and businesses can use data to make more profitable executive decisions.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Learning Consulting - </strong> Learning how to learn is a crucial skill that is, unfortunately, not often taught in schools. My seven-year journey towards finding the best learning methods - free of marketing hype and limited only to scientifically-backed methods - can be found in my book, <a href="//www.52aces.com/books">The Learning Factory</a>. If you're interested in applying these methods in your own life or in your company, I can come in and provide you with intense, individualized training that will put your learning capabilities into overdrive.</p>
                <p>I also offer services related to organizational structure and efficiency. Rather than come in and give your company a "rah rah" speech about how to stay motivated or some other self-help garbage, I can offer concrete, science-backed solutions. These optimizations allow employees and executives alike to function at their highest cognitive capacity, providing an environment that breeds succcessful goal completion.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Speaking Engagements</strong> - I thoroughly enjoy giving talks about a wide range of subjects that are both unique and informative. If you have a group or organization that would like to have me give a presentation about learning, memory, technology or anything else I have expertise in, I'd love to talk to you. To learn more about my presentation style, check out <a href="//52aces.com/blog/the-3-most-important-rules-for-public-speaking/">this blog post</a>.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Technology Consulting - </strong> Do you feel like your business is lacking in some way when it comes to technology? I can stop by and provide a top-down analysis of your company to make sure you're on the right track.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>If I can't help you for any reason, I'll do my best to refer you to someone who can.</p>
